Mastodon has a feature called "Content Warning".

TODO

Content Warning is required in toots that:

*   Contain traumatic subjects (such as: rape, violence).
*   Contain movie, tv show or game plots (i.e: 'Spoilers Power Rangers S01E01').
*   Contain nudity, sexual content and violent images (even if in drawing or artistic pictures)

*   Alcohol, tobacco and other drugs
*   Spiders, reptiles and other things that could cause discomfort in people with phobias
*   Selfies, specially with eye contact

### On privacy levels

<a name="privacy"></a>In Mastodon each status can be posted with one of three different audience configurations. It's important to have that in mind because certain rules apply only to one or other configuration:

*   Followers-only: The toot is sent to all followers, but does not appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, nor does it appear in hashtag searches.
*   Unlisted: The toot is sent to all followers, appear in the public profile page of the person that posted it, but does not appear in hashtag searches.
*   Public: The toot is sent to the "local" and "federated" timelines (which are shared by other members of the instance), is sent to all followers, appears in the public profile page of the person that posted it and appears in hashtag searches.

### On Crossposters

Crossposters are tools, automated or otherwise, used to post from other networks (such as Twitter or Tumblr) into Mastodon. The use of such tools is allowed, but the following rules apply:

1.  Retweets, quotes (retweets with comments) or reblogs **cannot** be posted with the "Public" privacy setting.
2.  Posts coming from other networks, such as Twitter, still need to obey to the other rules described in this code of conduct, such as the content warning policy.
3.  Crossposters can only be used with the condition that you follow your notifications, otherwise they will result in suspension after a first warning.

### How to report a code of conduct violation

Mastodon has tools for reporting toots and profiles. Any toot or profile you believe that's violating a rule of this code can be reported using the reporting tools and it will be sent to all moderators.

If your report is relative to one of the moderators, you can report the violation through direct message to one of the other moderators.

You can report a toot or profile even if the situation is not described directly in these rules, if the situation cause you discomfort. The moderation team will evaluate each case individually.

We will respond in a private manner to all reports we receive, making an effort that the first response is given in the first 24 hours.
